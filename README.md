# prometheus_task
Web app (not functional)
I am using Flask and SQLite for this project, however I encountered an error with SQLite that I could not resolve. As I am using it for the first time, I am unfamiliar with the backend. Given some time I would be able to fix it.
I apologize for submitting code that doesn't run, if some time is provided I would be able to fix it for sure.
